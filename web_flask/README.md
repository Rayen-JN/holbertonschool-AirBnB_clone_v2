## Description of the project :
The goal of the Holbertonschool - AirBnB clone project is to deploy a replica of the Airbnb Website using my server. The final version of this project will have:

  *A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)
  * A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities
  * A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities
  * An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb)

But also in non-interactive mode:
```python
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help

$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
